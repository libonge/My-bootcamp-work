# Conversion

# Type in a a "import math" to alert python that we are gonna use some of the math module functions.

import math

 # num1 into to an integer

# To covert "num1" into in a integer  use the "int" function.

# num2 into an float

# To convert "num2" into in a integer use the float function.

print(num2,   '             '   ,float(num2))

# num3 into a string 
#To convert "num3" into a string use the "str" function.

 # num4 into an integer 
 #To convert "string1" into a string use the int method.
